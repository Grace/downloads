# Code and data from the UC Berkeley Fung Institute

## Code repositories


* The most current fork of the [Python preprocessor](https://github.com/doolin/patentprocessor).
* Latest [disambiguation code](https://bitbucket.org/doolin/disambiguator/).

Both the preprocessor and the disambiguation code will get forked into
Fung Institute github repos in late 2012 or 2013. The repos above are the
best ones to fork for contributing at the moment.

## Applications and APIs

A prototype API server is under development right now (November 6, 2012).
A lightweight application is being built on top of the API, and serves
as a proof-of-concept. The anticipated development looks like this:

1. Combined application and API for developing use cases.
2. API for serving parsed, cleaned, consolidated  & disabiguatedpatent 
data split from application as an independent service.
3. Prototype consumes json via API from patent service.

Prototype application will be operating by close of 2012.
